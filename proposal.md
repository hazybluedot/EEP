# Overview

Advancing holistic engineering formation requires educators to think integratively about the relationship between technical and professional skills. While standalone courses such as technical writing and engineering ethics are common [@shuman_2005], situated learning [@newstetter_learning_2014, @johri_2014, @lave] highlights the importance of creating learning environments in which students can develop and practice technical and professional skills in tandem, mirroring professional practice. Such integration is common in capstone and cornerstone design courses [e.g. @trent_2014; @paretti_2008; @howe_1???], but as Lord and Chen point out (2014), professional practice needs to be integrated more fully across the engineering curriculum.  Most commonly, possibly because of the prominence of the Writing Across the Curriculum movement (Russell), such integration focuses on including of writing in engineering courses (cite special issues). Ethics has similarly been integrated (need citations), and the increasing emphasis on project-based learning has led to an increased use of teams (Kolmos?), though not necessarily explicit attention on helping students learn effective teamwork skills.
